# Modifications:

## Summary

After I finished my final milestone, which was trying to get it working, I then worked on changing the voice and also getting a lamp that my voice could activate. For the voice changer, I first imported Google Text to Speech to be my voice and chose a sample there. I then used that voice as my code. After this, I worked on getting my lamp to work. I first worked on soldering wires to the buttons of the lamp so it could connect to the relay module, and then it would connect to the Raspberry Pi. After that, I would code the lamp to light up with some Python code. I also used Onshape, a CAD software that can 3d print a case for my Raspberry Pi Voice Assistant. This will be it for my modifications.

## Challenges

A challenge I faced while trying to do the first part of my modifications was soldering the wires to the buttons. This was a challenge because everything went wrong. First of all, when I was trying to solder my wires to the chip with the button, the button fell off. This was crazy because I didn't even know I could do that because the solder that the company uses melts at a higher temperature. After this, I thought, "Oh, since I already desoldered one button, I should desolder the rest!" Well, that did not go so well. When I tried to desolder the second button, it wouldn't budge, and it ended up messy. There was also an LED that lit up when the lamp got power, but when I was desoldering, I broke the LED. Then I decided to just keep the buttons in because it was too much of a hassle.
And on top of that, when I finally took off the second button, part of the chip that makes the lamp work also broke off! So I had to connect the wire to another part of the chip to get it working. I finally got the lamp working after so many hours of work. This was one of the main challenges I faced.

## Summary of BlueStamp Engineering

Overall, I had a great time at BlueStamp. It provided me with various opportunities like meeting new friends, helping my experience in engineering and coding, and most importantly, the aspect of competitiveness from the countless  sports games we played against the other classes. My time at BlueStamp was fulfilling as I learned many new things about engineering. The biggest challenge I faced when I was at BlueStamp was trying to problem-solve countless of my mistakes by myself. With the great instructors, I was able to solve these problems and made me able to complete my voice assistant with AI. Overall, my experience with BlueStamp was overwhelmingly positive and I hope my portfolio will convince you and others to join BlueStamp.


# Third Milestone

## Summary

After finishing my second milestone, I added a speaker to connect to my Raspberry Pi and the code to get the speaker and microphone working.

## Challenges

A challenge I encountered while building this project was trying to get the speaker going. When I was using the first speaker, I had a problem with linking it to the Raspberry Pi. The audio from the speaker wasn't working, but it worked for my computer and phone. AND, it also broke my Raspberry Pi and made the audio on my Raspberry Pi stop working. Since the speaker wasn't working for my Raspberry Pi, I had to get a new speaker for my Raspberry Pi, and another plus is that I also had to reinstall my Raspberry Pi to get that audio working. A double whoopie!! For my next milestone, I will be adding modifications like asking Alexa (the name of the voice assistant) to turn on or off an LED lamp and changing Alexa's voice because it sounds horrid. 



# Second Milestone

## Summary

After my first milestone, I worked on getting an Open AI key, an identifier that lets people use Open AI or Chat GPT in projects. I also linked a USB microphone to the Raspberry Pi so it could hear you. I then added code in the terminal to import things like speech recognition, the Open AI key, and the USB microphone. After finishing my project, I added a circuit using relays to try turning the lights on and off.

## Challenges

What has been surprising to me so far is that I never knew that you could use Chat GPT in your project. Another challenge I encountered was that wires would not stay in their holes when they were put in. This was challenging because the wires would always break apart from the breadboard, and I would always get confused about what holes the wires were just in. Also, since the LED is always so flimsy, it is hard to keep the LED in the wires. What is going to happen next for me is to code the speaker and microphone to make them able to hear and talk to you. After that, I would make sure that the voice assistant could be able to turn the lights on.


# First Milestone

## Summary

After I finished my starter project, I moved on to my main project, which is a voice assistant with AI. It will detect your command and transform the command into the thing that you want it to do. For example, if you say, "Hey Alexa! Turn off the lights." The voice assistant will then turn off the lights (the name for my voice assistant would be Alexa). This project is like Alexa or Siri. To build the voice assistant, you will have first to set up a Raspberry Pi and then start coding on the Pi to build the voice assistant. Afterward, wire in a speaker and microphone so the voice assistant can hear you and reply. And that's technically it. Right now, I have finished setting up my Raspberry Pi and started running tests on it to see if it works.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge I am facing is getting the Raspberry Pi set up. I had to get the installation on my computer, then add in the MicroSD card. Then I had to put it in my Raspberry Pi, then use an HDMI cord to try to connect it to a monitor, but I realized the cord was too big to fit. Then I had to get OBS to try to use Raspberry Pi on my computer, which didn't work because I installed the wrong version of OBS. And after 3 and a half hours of GRUELING work, I finally set up my Raspberry Pi. My plan to complete this project is to continue to follow the codes and add them to the Raspberry Pi to complete my voice assistant.

# Starter Project

## Summary

For my starter project, I built a retro arcade game. The retro arcade game is a console that lets you play classic old games like Tetris, Snakes, Race Cars, Space Invaders, and Slots. The game device can also play the sound, remove the sound, and turn the brightness up and down. I built the retro arcade game because I thought it would be a great way to understand the basics of engineering and learn how to solder things together. The game console works by pressing buttons. The buttons that you press will transmit messages to the chips, where they will be analyzed. After the chip analyzes the message, it will send another message to the LED screen to tell it what to do. Then the LED screen will light up according to the chip. That is how the game console works.  

## Challenges

A challenge I was facing when I did this project was that it was really hard to solder things together because of how small the game console was. Since the holes in the game console were so small, I couldn't solder things together without mistakes, like how I accidentally soldered some things that I didn't have to solder. The next project I will be doing is my main project. My main project is a voice assistant with AI. It will reply to you after you say something to it. If you ask what the time is, it will respond with the time. That will be my next project.
