Voice Assistance with AI

<!---#Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!--->

<!---You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:--->

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE 



# Second Milestone

After my first milestone, I worked on getting an Open AI key which is an identifier that can let people use Open AI or Chat GPT in projects. I also linked a speaker and microphone to the Raspberry Pi so it can hear and talk to you. I added a circuit using relays to try turning the lights on and off after I finished the project. What has been surprising to me so far is that I never knew that you could use Chat GPT in your project. Another challenge I encountered was that wires would not stay in their holes when they were put in. This was challenging because the wires would always break apart from the breadboard and I would always get confused about what holes the wires were just in. Also, since the LED is always so flimsy, it is hard to keep the LED in the wires. Before I could say I finished my final milestone, I had to code the microphone to make sure it was listening and code the speaker to make it respond. --->

After I finished my starter project, I moved on to my main project which is a voice assistant with AI. It will detect your command to it and transform the command into the thing that you want it to do. Like for example if you say "Hey Tom! turn off the lights." The voice assistant will then turn off the lights. This project is like Alexa or Siri. To build the voice Assistant, you will have to first set up a Raspberry Pi, and then, start coding in the Raspberry Pi to build the Voice Assistant. Afterward, wire in a speaker and microphone so the voice assistant can hear you and reply. And that's technically it. Right now, I have finished setting up my Raspberry Pi and started running tests on it to see if it works. The biggest challenge I am facing is getting Raspberry Pi set up. I had to get the installation on my computer then add in the MicroSD card. Then I had to put it in my Raspberry Pi, then use an HDMI cord to try to connect it to a monitor which I realize the cord is too big to fit. Then I had to get OBS to try to use Raspberry Pi on my computer which didn't work because I installed the wrong version of OBS. And after 3 and a half HOURS of grueling work, I finally set up my Raspberry Pi. My plan to complete this project is to continue to follow the codes and add them to the Raspberry Pi to complete my Voice Assistant.

# Starter Project

For my Starter project, I built the retro arcade game. The retro arcade game is a console that lets you play classic old games like Tetris, Snakes, Race Cars, Space Invaders, and Slots. The game device can also play sound or remove sound and turn the brightness up and down. I built the retro arcade game because I thought it would be a great way to understand the basics of engineering and learn how to solder things together. The game console works by pressing buttons. The buttons that you press will transmit messages to the chips where they will be analyzed. After the chip analyzed the message, it will then send another message to the LED screen to tell it what to do. Then the LED screen will light up according to the chip. That is how the game console works. A challenge I was facing when I did this project was that it was really hard to solder things together because of how small the game console was. Since the holes in the game console were so small, I couldn't solder things together without mistakes like how I accidentally soldered some things that I didn't have to solder. The next project I will be doing is my main project. My main project is a voice assistant with AI. It will reply to you after you say something to it. Like if you ask what the time is then it will respond with the time. That will be my next project.

<!--# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
``` -->

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts of your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

<!--# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
